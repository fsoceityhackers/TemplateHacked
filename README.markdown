# Tab example in AngularJS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jasoncluck/pen/iDcbh](https://codepen.io/jasoncluck/pen/iDcbh).

Simple example of using directives to control loading of content based on tab choice.  In a real application this functionality should probably be separated into it's own element directive and load the template via templateUrl in the directive definition.
